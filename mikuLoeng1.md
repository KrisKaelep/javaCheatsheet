What do you think programming is or what's related? 30sec
    solving problems
    syntax
    scripting
    bugs
    data
    productivity
    frustration
    automation
    applications
    instructions
    simplify
    ----
    algorithm
    plain text code
    syntax
    compiling
    loops
    input/output (I/O)
    data processing
    speed of execution

  CPU is what you're programming
    can not think (AI does not exist, perhaps will never exist)
    binary system
    processes trivial commands step-by-step
    digital information is determined (binary is electrical impulse)

  How binary works

  Algorithm
    human-oriented
      text
      diagram
      pseudo language
    computer-oriented
      code in any language
      java example

  Compiling (source code -> compiler -> executable)
  Scripting languages don't compile, run "directly"
  Java compiling (source -> compiler- > Java bytecode program -> Interpreter(VM) in any OS)

  Most popular compiled languages:
  C/C++ is the most used language in the world.
  Java
  C#
  Most popular scripting languages:
  JS
  Ruby
  PHP
  Python

  k천igis keeltes p천him천tteliselt sama.

  Aga on erinevaid viise, kuidas l채heneda ja vahel oleneb keele ehitusest, mida saab kasutada.

  Cars 100 years ago were different. eventually a good way of thing things was developed.

  imperative - step-by-step
  functional - an expression, formula
  declarative (logical) - describes what to do, not how (SQL)
  OOP - structural

  UNIX command line
    black window with text-only
    mostly deal with files
    everything is a file
    why cmd in 21st century?

  IDE
    Eclipse
    Netbeans
    Intellij

  variable
  branch
  loop
  subroutine
  class/object
